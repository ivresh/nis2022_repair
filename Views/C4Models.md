# C4 Model

C4 model considers the structure of a system in terms of context, containers, components, and code. The hierarchy of these diagrams to understand the system's architecture at the required level of detail. The diagrams presented below stand for context and containers - the highest levels of the model.

# Context Diagram

Context diagram is the most general description of the system's performance. It shows how the system fits into the environment in terms of the people who use it and the other  systems it interacts with.
